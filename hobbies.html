            <h3>Music</h3>
                <p>In my spare time, I greatly enjoy playing my violin. I've been playing it since
                    elementary school, and plan to keep going with it. I find that playing violin helps
                    tremendously whenever I've had a bad day. Music helps to put my mind at ease whenever
                    I'm feeling stressed.

                    My Dad also plays violin and listening to his playing growing up was one of the main reasons
                    I wanted to learn. Whenever I visit back home we play duets together. My personal favourite is
                    the J.S Bach double violin concerto in D Minor.

        <h3>Esports</h3>
        <section class="splatoon">
            <p id="splat_text">I also enjoy competing with friends in the Esports arena for the game series <i>Splatoon</i>.
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splatoon#" target="_blank">Splatoon</a> is a 3rd person shooter developed by Nintendo,
                with the added mechanic that the players shoot paint at each other, and can use this paint to sneak through terrain
                or climb walls. While seemingly simple upfront, this game has a surprising amount of depth to it.
                I've been playing Splatoon since the first game, and have been dedicated to pushing my favorite weapon: <br>
                <strong>Carbon Roller Deco</strong><br>
                I've played for two teams so far. One with my older brother, and one with my university. I'm proud to
                say I've accomplished quite a bit with each team.
